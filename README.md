### What can Kosmonaut do?

So far, not much.  Only a very limited subset of CSS is currently supported, so most web pages will not work.  However, given very basic HTML and CSS, Kosmonaut does render the right things â€” see Kosmonaut's rendering of [this code](https://github.com/twilco/kosmonaut/blob/eef5274c252038062049769861d02354cbaa4b2a/web/rainbow-divs-incl-css.html), compared with that of Firefox:

### Build

Kosmonaut is built with Rust using OpenGL bindings via [gl-rs](https://github.com/brendanzab/gl-rs), [Glutin](https://github.com/rust-windowing/glutin) for window management and OpenGL context creation, Servo's [html5ever](https://github.com/servo/html5ever) and [cssparser](https://github.com/servo/rust-cssparser) for HTML and CSS parsing, and various other auxiliary libraries.

To build from source:

1. Install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. `cargo build`

Kosmonaut does not currently support any networking.  To render HTML and CSS with Kosmonaut, you may instead run the executable you just built passing any number of HTML and CSS files via the `--files` (or `-f`) flag.

`cargo run -- --files my.html my.css more.css`

To run the rainbow divs example pictured above, try:

`cargo run -- --files tests/websrc/rainbow-divs.html tests/websrc/rainbow-divs.css`
 
### License and credits

Kosmonaut's current implementation is heavily inspired by [Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo), sometimes taking code directly from it.  Thus, Kosmonaut is licensed with the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).

Kosmonaut also takes inspiration from [Robinson](https://github.com/mbrubeck/robinson).  Thanks to [mbrubeck](https://github.com/mbrubeck) for their great series of articles on browser engines.

Finally, Kosomonaut's DOM implementation was taken from [Kuchiki](https://github.com/kuchiki-rs/kuchiki) and has been slightly modified to fit our needs.
